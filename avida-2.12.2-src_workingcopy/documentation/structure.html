<h1>Directory and File Structure</h1>
</div>

<p>
This document contains a guide to the files present in Avida, and where they are located.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Filenames</h2>

<p>
Source code files in Avida follow a standard naming convention.  The C++ core,
in general, maintains one class per header/source file pair.  The file name
should exactly match the class that it defines.  All header files use
<code>.h</code> and all source files use
<code>.cc</code> as their respective file extensions.
</p>
<p>
When you compile a program in C++, it goes through a <em>compilation</em> phase
and then a <em>link</em> phase.  The compilation phase takes each source (<code>.cc</code>)
file and compiles it independently into an object (<code>.o</code>) file.  In the
link phase, all of these compiled object files are linked together into a
single executable (such as <kbd>avida</kbd>).
</p>
<p>
Since the bodies of the methods are only in the source files, they only need
to be compiled once into a single object file.  If you place a function
body in the header file it will get compiled again each time another
class includes that header.  Since a header will often be included because
only one or two methods from a class are required, this can increase compile
time dramatically -- a function will be compiled as long as its body is included, even
if the method is never directly called within the object file being created.

<p>
For example: The cOrganism object is declared in the file
<code>cOrganism.h</code> and fully
defined in <code>cOrganism.cc</code>.  When
this file is compiled, it creates the object file
<code>cOrganism.o</code>.  Both the cPopulation
class (<code>cPopulation.cc</code>) and the
cTestCPU class (<code>cTestCPU.cc</code>) use
the cOrganism object.  Since the majority of its methods are defined in
<code>cOrganism.cc</code>, the compiler only
needs to be compile these methods once.  During the link phase
the linker connects the references together.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally short functions are implemented with their bodies directly in the
header file.  When a function compiled in one object file is run from another,
the linker basically points the caller to the location of that function.
A few extra CPU cycles must be expended while the program jumps to the function.
Many small function, especially one line access methods, can be made <em>inline</em>,
which means it will be placed, as a whole, right inside of the function that calls
it.  If the function is short enough, it only takes up as much space as the
call to it would have taken anyway, and hence does not increase the size
of the executable.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Directory Structure</h2>

<p>
The following sections provide a high level overview of the directory structure
within the Avida source code distribution.  Many directory sections contain
partial listings of the files contained within them, however these list are not
to be considered complete.
</p>

<h3>Top Level Directory</h3>

All of the files for the current version of Avida reside in the directory
labeled <kbd style="color: #008844">trunk/</kbd> by default when checked

<p>
Templates are special classes that interact with another data-type
that doesn't need to be specified until the programmer instantiates an object
in the class.  Its a hard concept to get used to, but allows for remarkably
flexible programming, and makes very reusable code.  The main drawback
(other than brain-strain) is that templates must be entirely defined in
header files since separate code is generated for each class the template
interacts with.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><kbd style="color: #000088">tArray.h</kbd></dt>
<dd>
A fixed-length array template; array sizes may be adjusted manually

recent first.
</dd>
<dt><kbd style="color: #000088">tDictionary.h</kbd></dt>

based on a keyword (of type cString).

<dt><kbd style="color: #000088">tManagedPointerArray.h</kbd></dt>
<dd>
A derivative of tArray, a managed pointer array is ideal for storing
arrays of large objects that may need to be resized.  The backing

</dd>
<dt><kbd style="color: #000088">tMemTrack.h</kbd></dt>

This is a template that can be put over any class or data type to keep
track of it.  If all creations of objects in the class are done through
this template rather than (or in conjunction with) "new", memory leaks
should be detectable. This is new, and not yet used in Avida.
</dd>
<dt><kbd style="color: #000088">tSmartArray.h</kbd></dt>
<dd>

adjusted to accommodate any positions accessed in it.
