<title>Other Notation : Bitwise</title>

<h1>Bitwise</h1>

A bitwise operation is one in which each bit is treated independently of all the other bits in a number. Thus if a logical AND was performed between two bitstrings, the first bit of the first string would be ANDed to the first bit in the second string, the second bit to the second bit and so on.
