<title>CPU Components : Heads</title>

<h1>Heads</h1>

Each <a href="help.CPU.html">CPU</a>  has four heads associated with it. The first is the instruction pointer (IP) which determines the next <a href="help.Instruction.html">instruction</a>  to be executed by the CPU. After each execution, the IP is automaticall advanced (unless the instruction executed dictates otherwise). The second is the read-head (RH), which determines what instruction is copied from a copy command, and then the write-head (WH) determines the position it is copied to. Finally, the flow-head (FH) is used to mark positions in the genome to move the other heads to. The flow-head is commonly used to mark the beginning of a loop to jump the IP back to from the loop's end.
