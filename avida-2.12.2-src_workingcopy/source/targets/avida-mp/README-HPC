AVIDA-MP on the HPCC
========

This README is MSU-specific, and applies to those who wish to use Avida-MP on the HPCC.

First, go read the other README, and follow the directions therein.  Make sure that you can build & run the MPI test program provided by Boost.

As of this writing (9/2010), the HPC provides OpenMPI libraries for the Intel compiler suite only.  Unfortunately, Boost MPI is not able to auto-detect the MPI configuration on the HPCC.  You'll need something like the following in your ~/user-config.jam file (assuming that the Boost install prefix is ${HOME}):

using intel : 11.0 ;
using intel : openmpi : /opt/hpc/openmpi/openmpi-1.3.3/bin/mpic++ ;
local LIB = $(HOME)/lib ;
project user-config : requirements <include>$(HOME)/include ;
lib boost_serialization
    :
    : <toolset>intel <name>boost_serialization-il-mt <search>$(LIB)
    ;
lib boost_mpi : : <toolset>intel <name>boost_mpi-il-mt <search>$(LIB) ;

Now, you should be able to go to avida/development, and type this:
    bjam toolset=intel-openmpi avida-mp
... and after a while, it should return something like this:

intel-linux.archive source/bin/intel-linux-openmpi/debug/link-static/threading-multi/libavida-core.a
intel-linux.link source/targets/avida-mp/bin/intel-linux-openmpi/debug/avida-mp
/opt/intel/Compiler/11.0/083/lib/intel64/libimf.so: warning: warning: feupdateenv is not implemented and will always fail
...updated 142 targets...

If it doesn't, go back and try to get Boost's test MPI program working with bjam.  Boost's documentation is your friend!
