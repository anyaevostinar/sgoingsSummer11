About Avida-MP
========

Avida-MP is a multi-process-aware version of Avida.  It uses MPI to communicate among processes which could be running locally or elsewhere in a network.  It is written using the Boost MPI library.  Building and using Avida-MP thus requires a functional Boost installation with MPI support.


Installing Boost
========
Building and installing Boost is beyond the scope of this README.  Go here:
    http://www.boost.org/
download the latest version, and follow the directions for building Boost for your platform.  Be sure to read the MPI-specific directions as well.

Next, configure your build environment so that Boost::MPI programs can be built.  See the documentation for Boost::MPI.  This may be non-trivial depending on your platform.  For example, something like the following in user-config.jam is needed on OS X (as of this writing):

using darwin : openmpi : /opt/local/bin/openmpic++ ;
project user-config :
    requirements <include>$(HOME)/include <include>/opt/local/include
;
local LIB = "/opt/local/lib" ;
lib boost_serialization : : <name>boost_serialization-mt <search>$(LIB) ;
lib boost_mpi : : <name>boost_mpi-mt <search>$(LIB) ;


Building Avida-MP
========
From here: bjam
From Avida root: bjam avida-mp

If you have multiple toolsets installed (e.g., GCC and MPI), be sure to use the one configured for MPI:
    bjam toolset=darwin-openmpi
