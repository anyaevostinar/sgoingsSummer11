<p>
This is the setup file for the task/resource system in Avida.
</p>
<p>
Five main keywords are used in this file, RESOURCE, REACTION, CELL, MUTATION, 
and SET_ACTIVE.  Their
formats are:
</p>
<pre>
  <a href="#RESOURCE">RESOURCE</a>  resource_name[:options]  {resource_name ...}
  <a href="#REACTION">REACTION</a>  reaction_name  task  [process:...]  [requisite:...]
  <a href="#CELL">CELL</a> resource_name:cell_list[:flow]
  <a href="#MUTATION">MUTATION</a> name trigger scope type rate
  <a href="#SET_ACTIVE">SET_ACTIVE</a> type name new_status(default=true)
</pre>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
All entries on a resource line are names of individual resources. Resources can
have a global quantity depletable by all organisms or can have quantities that
vary from cell to cell.  The resource name
<code>infinite</code> is used to refer to an undepletable resource.  There are
two basic commands to set up a resource: RESOURCE and CELL.
</p>

<h3><A name = "RESOURCE">RESOURCE Command</A></h3>

<p>The syntax for the Resource command is:</p>

  <pre>RESOURCE resource_name[:options]  {resource_name ...}</pre>

<Blockquote> 
<P>
Where <code>resource_name</code> is a unique name of the resource.  This name
may be used by the <code>CELL</code> command to further define the resource or
in the <code>REACTION</code> to define which resource is consumed/created
by a reaction.
</P>
<P>
Where <code>options</code> is a colon delimited list of factors that modify the 
resource. The following chart specifies these options.

<p>
An example of a RESOURCE statement that begins a run with a fixed amount of the
(global) resource in the environment, but has no inflow or outflows is:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  glucose:initial=10000
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you wanted to make this into a chemostat with a 10000 equilibrium
concentration for unused resources, you could put:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  maltose:initial=10000:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you want a resource that exists spatially where the resource enters
from the top and flows towards the bottom where it exits the system,
you could use:
<pre>
  RESOURCE lactose:geometry=grid:initial=100000:inflow=100:outflow=0.1:\
  inflowx1=0:inflowx2=100:inflowy1=0:inflowy2=0:outflowx1=0:outflowx2=100:\
  outflowy1=100:outflowy2=100:ygravity=0.5
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Defining a resource with no parameters means that it will start at a zero
quantity and have no inflow or outflow.  This is sometimes desirable if you
want that resource to only be present as a byproduct of a reaction.
Remember, though, that you should still have an outflow rate if it's in
a chemostat.
</p>
<h3><a name="CELL">CELL Command</a></h3>
<p>
Using Cell can help increase the detail of a spatial resource.  Any cell in a
grid can be given their own initial amount of a resource, inflow amount and 
outflow rate.  These values are in addition to any other values set for the
spatial resource for the entire for the grid (diffusion and gravity for 
instance). The command has the format:
</p>
  <pre>CELL resource_name:cell_list[:options]</pre>
<p>
<Blockquote>
Where <code>resource_name</code> is the name of the spatial resource that this 
cell command will modify.  If this resource has not been defined yet a new 
resource with this name will be created.
</P>
<p>
Where <code>cell_list</code> is comma delimited list of cells that will be set.
We treat the grid like a one dimensional array where 0 is the upper left corner,
world_x - 1 is the upper right corner, and (world_x * world_y) - 1 is the 
lower right corner.  As well as single cell you can also enter a range of 
cells by using the format a..b.
</P>

Where <code>options</code> is a colon delimited list of factors that modify the 
resource. The following chart specifies these options.

<h2>Reactions</h2>

<p>
Reactions are set to allow organisms to consume or produce resources when those
organisms preform certain tasks.  Reactions can be used to reward (or punish) 
organisms for performing tasks or to set up a "food web". They 
are described by the task that triggers them, the processes they
perform (including resources used and the results of using them), and
requisites on when they can occur.

  <p>
  Where <code>requisite</code> is a colon delimited list describing when

<p>
Each reaction must have a task that triggers it.  Currently, eighty tasks
have been implemented, as summarized in the following table (in approximate
order of complexity):

When describing a reaction, the <code>process</code> portion determines consumption
of resources, their byproducts, and the resulting bonuses.  There are several

<p>
If no process is given, a single associated process with all default
settings is assumed.  If multiple process statements are given, <em>all</em> are
acted upon when the reaction is triggered.  Assuming you were going to set
all of the portions of process to be their default values, this portion of
the reaction statement would appear as:
<pre>
  process:resource=infinite:value=1:type=add:max=1:min=0:frac=1:product=none:conversion=1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This statement has many redundancies; for example, it would indicate that the
associated reaction should use the infinite resource, making 'frac' and 'min'
settings irrelevant.  Likewise, since 'product' is set to none, the
'conversion' rate is never considered.
</p>

The <code>requisite</code> entry limits when this reaction can be triggered.  The

  REACTION AND logic:2a process:type=mult:value=4.0   requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION EQU logic:2h process:type=mult:value=32.0  requisite:max_count=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
No RESOURCE statements need be included since only the infinite resource is
used (by default, since we don't specify another resource's name)
# To create an environment with two resources that are converted back and
forth as tasks are performed, we might have:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  yummyA:initial=1000
  RESOURCE  yummyB:initial=1000
  REACTION  AtoB  gobbleA  process:resource=yummyA:frac=0.001:product=yummyB
  REACTION  BtoA  gobbleB  process:resource=yummyB:frac=0.001:product=yummyA
</pre>
</p>
<p>
A value of 1.0 per reaction is default.  Obviously <code>gobbleA</code> and 
<code>gobbleB</code> would have to be tasks described within Avida.
</p>

<p>
A requisite against the other reaction being performed would prevent a
single organism from garnering both rewards in equal measure.
</p>
<p>
As an example, to simulate a chemostat, we might have:
<pre>
  RESOURCE glucose:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This would create a resource called "glucose" that has a fixed inflow rate of
10000 units where 20% flows out every update.  (Leaving a steady state of
50,000 units if no organism-consumption occurs).
</p>

<p>
Limitations to this system:
<ul>
<li>
  Only a single resource can be required at a time, and only a single
  by-product can be produced.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default setup is:
<pre>
  REACTION  NOT  not   process:value=1.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  NAND nand  process:value=1.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  AND  and   process:value=2.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  ORN  orn   process:value=2.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  OR   or    process:value=3.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  ANDN andn  process:value=3.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  NOR  nor   process:value=4.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  XOR  xor   process:value=4.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  EQU  equ   process:value=5.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This creates an environment where the organisms get a bonus for performing
any of nine tasks.  Since none of the reactions are associated with a
resource, the infinite resource is assumed, which is non-depeletable.
The max_count of one means they can only get the bonus from each reaction
a single time.
</p>

<p>
A similar setup that has 9 resources, one corresponding to each of the nine
possible tasks listed above is:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  resNOT:inflow=100:outflow=0.01   resNAND:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  RESOURCE  resAND:inflow=100:outflow=0.01   resORN:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  RESOURCE  resOR:inflow=100:outflow=0.01    resANDN:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  RESOURCE  resNOR:inflow=100:outflow=0.01   resXOR:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  RESOURCE  resEQU:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  
  REACTION  NOT  not   process:resource=resNOT:value=1.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  NAND nand  process:resource=resNAND:value=1.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  AND  and   process:resource=resAND:value=2.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  ORN  orn   process:resource=resORN:value=2.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  OR   or    process:resource=resOR:value=4.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  ANDN andn  process:resource=resANDN:value=4.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  NOR  nor   process:resource=resNOR:value=8.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  XOR  xor   process:resource=resXOR:value=8.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  EQU  equ   process:resource=resEQU:value=16.0:frac=0.0025
</pre>

<H2>Other Commands</H2>
<h3>SET_ACTIVE Command</h3>
<p>
Allows user to activate or deactivate a reaction. If this command is not 
used all reactions are active.
</p>
<pre>
  <a name="SET_ACTIVE">SET_ACTIVE</a> type name new_status(default=true)
</pre>
<blockquote>
  <P>
  Where <code>type</code> is the type of command to activate/deactivate.
  Currently <b>REACTION</b> is the only choice.
  </P>
  <p>
  Where <code>name</code> is the name of the item to activate/deactivate.
  </p>
  <p>
  Where <code>new_status</code> sets if the item is active (0 or FALSE will
  deactivate).
</Blockquote>
<p>
<H3>MUTATION Command</H3>
O.K. I don't know what the following command does, but it is in the code:
