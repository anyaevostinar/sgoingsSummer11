<h1>Registers</h1>

<p>
A register is a storage space for a single number. 
Each classic <a href="help.CPU.html">CPU</a> in Avida contains three registers, each of which is made up of 32 bits. All math-based <a href="help.Instruction.html">instructions</a>  opperate on the registers, and various instruction will move the values in the registers around.
