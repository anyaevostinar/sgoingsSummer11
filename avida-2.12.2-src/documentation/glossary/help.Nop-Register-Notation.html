<h1>Nop-Register-Notation</h1>

A <a href="help.Registers.html">register</a>  name (AX, BX, or CX) surrounded by question marks refers to that register being used by default when the <a href="help.Instruction.html">instruction</a>  in question is being executed, but if the instruction is followed by a <a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a>  (nop) instruction, the nop will alter the register used. A nop-A instruction indicates AX, nop-B is BX, and nop-C is CX.
