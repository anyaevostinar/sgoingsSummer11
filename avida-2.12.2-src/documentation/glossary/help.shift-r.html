<title>Instruction : shift-r</title>

<h1>shift-r</h1>

This instruction reads in the contents of the <a href="help.Nop-Register-Notation.html">?BX?</a>  register, and shifts all of the bits in that register to the right by one. In effect, it divides the value stored in the register by two, rounding down.
