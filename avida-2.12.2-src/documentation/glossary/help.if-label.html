<h1>if-label</h1>

This instruction reads in the <a href="help.Template.html">template</a>  that follows it, and tests if its <a href="help.Complement-Template.html">complement</a>  template was the most recent series of instructions copied. If so, it executed the next instruction, otherwise it skips it. This instruction is commonly used for an organism to determine when it has finished producing its offspring.
