<title>Instruction : if-less</title>

<h1>if-less</h1>

This instruction compares the <a href="help.Nop-Register-Notation.html">?BX?</a>  register to its <a href="help.Complement-Template.html">complement</a>. If ?BX? is the lesser of the pair, the next instruction (after a modifying <a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a>  instruction, if one is present) is executed. If it is greater or equal, then that next instruction is skipped.
