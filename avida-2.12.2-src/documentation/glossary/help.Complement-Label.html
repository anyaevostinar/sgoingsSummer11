<title>Other Notation : Complement-Label</title>

<h1>Complement-Label</h1>

The complement of a <a href="help.Label.html">label</a>  is found by taking each 
<a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a> instruction that makes up that label, 
and shifting it to the next in alphabetical order, looping around at the end. 
Thus, in the default instruction set, nop-A -> nop-B -> nop-C -> nop-A. The label 
"nop-B nop-A nop-C nop-C" has the complement "nop-C nop-B nop-A nop-A".
