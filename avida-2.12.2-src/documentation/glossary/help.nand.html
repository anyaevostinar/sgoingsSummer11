<h1>nand</h1>

This instruction reads in the contents of the BX and CX <a href="help.Registers.html">registers</a>  (each of which are 32-bit numbers) and performs a <a href="help.Bitwise.html">bitwise</a>  nand operation on them. The result of this operation is placed in the <a href="help.Nop-Register-Notation.html">?BX?</a>  register. Note that this is the only <a href="help.Logic.html">logic</a>  operation provided in the basic avida instruction set.
