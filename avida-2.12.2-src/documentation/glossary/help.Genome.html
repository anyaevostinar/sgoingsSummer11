<h1>Genome</h1>

The genome of an organism is the original, underlying program that controls the behavior of that organism. The <a href="help.Memory.html">memory</a>  space in the <a href="help.CPU.html">CPU</a>  of that organism is initialized to the genome, but will change with time. A <a href="help.Genotype.html">genotype</a>  is is determined by a unique genome sequence.
