<h1>Label</h1>

A label (sometimes called a template -- for example, in biology) is a sequence of 
<a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a>  instructions used to mark 
regions of code within a <a href="help.Genome.html">genome</a>. Some instructions 
(such a <a href="help.h-search.html">h-search</a>) are followed by a label; the 
<a href="help.Complement-Label.html">complement</a>  of that label is then used 
to match against other labels. See the descriptions of the individual 
<a href="help.Instruction.html">instructions</a> for how they use labels.
