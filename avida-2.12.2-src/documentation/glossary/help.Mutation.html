<h1>Mutation</h1>

A mutation is a random change of an <a href="help.Instruction.html">instruction</a>  from the <a href="help.Genome.html">genome</a>  of an <a href="help.Organism.html">organism</a>. There are three main times that mutations can occur; point mutations will happen randomly through time, with and equal probability at every site, copy mutations occur when a site is actively being copied, and divide mutations occur when an organim is splitting off an offspring.
