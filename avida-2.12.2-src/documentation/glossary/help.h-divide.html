<title>Instruction : h-divide</title>

<h1>h-divide</h1>

This instruction is used for an organism to divide off an finnished offspring. The original organism keeps the state of its <a href="help.Memory.html">memory</a>  up until the <a href="help.Heads.html">read-head</a>. The offspring's memory is initialized to everything between the read-head and the <a href="help.Heads.html">write-head</a>. All memory past the write-head is removed entirely.
