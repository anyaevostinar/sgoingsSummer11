<h1>Nop-Head-Notation</h1>

A <a href="help.Heads.html">head</a>  abbreviation (IP, RH, WH, or FH) surrounded by question marks refers to that head being used as a default, when the <a href="help.Instruction.html">instruction</a>  in question is being executed, but if the instruction is followed by a <a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a>  (nop) instruction, the nop will alter the register used. A nop-A instruction indicates the instruction pointer (IP), nop-B is the read-head (RH), nop-C is the write-head (WH), and there is no way to use the flow-head (FH) unless it is by default.
