<title>Instruction : shift-l</title>

<h1>shift-l</h1>

This instruction reads in the contents of the <a href="help.Nop-Register-Notation.html">?BX?</a>  register, and shifts all of the bits in that register to the left by one, placing a zero as the new rightmost bit, and trunkating any bits beyond the 32 maximum. For values that require fewer than 32 bits, it effectively multiplies that value by two.
