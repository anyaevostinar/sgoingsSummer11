<h1>Tasks</h1>

The <a href="help.Organism.html">organisms</a>  in avida are granted extra <a href="help.CPU-cycle.html">CPU-cycles</a>  for performing specific computations. Every time an organisms <a href="help.Input-Output.html">outputs</a>  a number, it is examined against the inputs to determine if any tasks have been compleated. If the number of extra CPU-cycles outweigh the number used to perform the task, the computation will typically be reinforced through natural selection. By default, the tasks in avida are all <a href="help.Logic.html">logic</a>  operations that act upon the <a href="help.Input-Output.html">inputs</a>  in a <a href="help.Bitwise.html">bitwise</a>  fashion.
