<title>Instruction : h-copy</title>

<h1>h-copy</h1>

This instruction reads the contents of the organism's <a href="help.Memory.html">memory</a>  at the position of the <a href="help.Heads.html">read-head</a>, and copy that to the position of the <a href="help.Heads.html">write-head</a>. If a non-zero copy mutation rate is set, a test will be made based on this probability to determine if a <a href="help.Mutation.html">mutation</a>  occurs. If so, a random instruction (chosen from the full set with equal probability) will be placed at the write-head instead.
