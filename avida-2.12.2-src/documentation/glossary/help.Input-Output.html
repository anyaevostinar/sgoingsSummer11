Each <a href="help.CPU.html">CPU</a>  in avida is supplied with 3 input values of 32 bits each. The <a href="help.IO.html">IO</a>  instruction is used by the organisms to get the an input (cyclying through the three options) into a <a href="help.Registers.html">register</a>  and to output numbers from a register. Each ouput is compared to all inputs to determing if any <a href="help.Tasks.html">tasks</a>  (by default, specified logical computations) have been performed by the organism.
