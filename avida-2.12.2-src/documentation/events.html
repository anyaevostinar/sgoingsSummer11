<h1>The Events File</h1>
</div>

<p>
The events file controls events that need to occur throughout the course of
a run.  This includes the output of data files as well as active events that
effect the population (such as extinction events or changes to the mutation
rate).
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>File Formats</h2>

<p>
This file consists of a list of events that will be triggered either singly
or periodically.  The format for each line is:
</p>
<pre>
type  timing  event  arguments
</pre>

<p>
The <code>type</code> determines what kind of timings the event will be based off
of.  This can be immediate [<code>i</code>], based on update [<code>u</code>], or based
on generation [<code>g</code>].
</p>
<p>
The <code>timing</code> should only be included for non-immediate events.  If a
single number is given for timing, the event occurs at that update/generation.
A second number can be included (seperated by a colon ':') to indicate how
often the event should be repeated.  And if a third number is listed (again,
colon seperated) this will be the last time the event can occur on.  For
example, the type and timing <code>u 100:100:5000</code> would indicate that the
event that follows first occurs at update 100, and repeats every 100 updates
thereafter until update 5000.  A type timing of <code>g 10:10</code> would cause the
event to be triggered every 10 generations for the entire run.
</p>
<p>
The <code>event</code> is simply the name of the action that should be performed,
and the <code>arguments</code> detail exactly how it should work when it is
triggered.  Each action has its own arguments. See the
<a href="actions.html">List of Actions</a> for details about all of the
available options.
</p>

<p>
Some examples:
</p>
<div class="sub">
  <p>
  <code>i Inject</code>
  <br />
  Inject an additional start creature immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
  <code>u 100:100 PrintAverageData</code>
  <br />Print out all average measurements collected every one hundred updates,
  starting at update 100.
  </p>

  <p>
  <code>g 10000:10:20000 PrintData dom_info.dat update,dom_fitness,dom_depth,dom_sequence</code>
  <br />Between generations 10,000 and 20,000, append the specified information to
  the file <kbd>dom_info.dat</kbd> every ten generations.  Specifically, the first
  column in the file would be update number, second is the fitness of
  the dominant genotype, followed by the depth in the phylogentic
  tree of the dominant genotype, and finally its genome sequence.
