<h1>Instruction Implementation Checklist</h1>
</div>

<p>
This document discusses how to implement your own instructions.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Build the method to be attached to the new instruction</h2>

<p>
For this first step, you will be editing the virtual CPU definition in 
<kbd>cHardwareCPU.h</kbd> and <kbd>cHardwareCPU.cc</kbd>, both of which are
found in the directory <kbd>source/cpu/</kbd>.  Start by going to the
final section of the class definition in the header file and writing
the declaration for the new method that will be called whenever the
instruction is executed. For example, if you were going to add the
instruction <code>minus-17</code> (which performs the oh-so-useful behavior
of subtracting 17 from the ?BX? register), you would add the line:
</p>
<pre>
bool <span class="method">Inst_Minus17</span>(<span class="class">cAvidaContext</span>&amp; <span class="object">ctx</span>);
</pre>

<p>
If possible, place it near other instructions of the same type.  There are
about a hundred methods cHardwareCPU.  This instruction would likely fit best
with the group of instruction described as &quot;Single-Argument Math&quot;.
That is, all those instructions that perform mathematical operation that only
affect a single register.
</p>
<p>
All methods associated with instructions return a
<span class="class">bool</span> value that determines if it was
successfully executed.  Most instructions will always return true since they
have now way to fail.  The convention that we use to designate a method
explicitly associated with an instruction is placing a prefix of
<code>Inst_</code> in front of it.
</p>
<p>
Next, you have to write the function body in the code file
(<kbd>cHardwareCPU.cc</kbd>).  The method bodies will be listed at the end of
this file in the same order that they were declared in the header. You would
find the proper position, and write something to the effect of:
</p>

<pre>
void <span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Inst_Minus17</span>(<span class="class">cAvidaContext</span>&amp; <span class="object">ctx</span>)
{
  const <span class="class">int</span> <span class="object">reg_used</span> = <span class="method">FindModifiedRegister</span>(nHardwareCPU::REG_BX);
  <span class="method">GetRegister</span>(<span class="object">reg_used</span>) -= 17;
  return true;
}
</pre>

<p>
The first line of this method uses a helper function called
<span class="method">FindModifiedRegister</span>() to identify the register
that should be affected (it scans the next instruction to test if it is a
<code>nop</code>), with a default value of <code>REG_BX</code> passed in.
The second line then subtracts 17 from the value in that register.  The
constant values and available helper functions will be described in more
detail below, as will a guide to accessing the components in the virtual
CPU.  For the moment, you have finished implementing the method!
</p>
<p>
Note that this would be a good time to recompile if you want to test how
well your implementation is going so far.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Link the instruction name to its method</h2>

For this step, you will need to edit the code file.  You would go into the method
<span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">initInstLib</span>()
and add in the line

<pre>
<span class="class">cInstEntryCPU</span>(&quot;minus-17&quot;, &amp;<span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Inst_Minus17</span>);
</pre>

<p>
in the same order that it was defined in the class definition.
</p>
<p>
Since we want to use a pointer to the appropriate method, that is what we
must pass into the dictionary.  To obtain said pointer, we must list the class
the function is part of (<span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>) follow it
by a double colon (::) and then give the method name
(<span class="method">Inst_Minus17</span>) <em>without</em> the normal
parentheses following it.  The parentheses indicate that we should execute
the method.  Without them, it is just the data that represents the method,
and by preceding this whole mess with an ampersand ('&amp;') we get the pointer
to the location in memory that the method resides.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If your instruction interacts with the population, resources,
or IO, make sure to flag the instruction for speculative stall by adding a third
 argument, <i>nInstFlags::STALL</i>.  For an example, look at the 'h-divide'
 instruction.
</p>
<p>
Compile again, and you should have your instruction ready for use.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Add the entry to your instruction set and test it!</h2>

<p>
This last part should be the easiest.  If you want the new instruction you
just created to be loaded on startup, you must add a line in the instruction
set you are using (specified in the configuration file) to indicate its
inclusion:
</p>
<pre>
minus-17 1
</pre>

<p>
And there you have it!  Now the real trick is to test if its working 
properly.  I'd recommend using as a framework the creature
<kbd>default-classic.org</kbd> and modifying some of the long series of
<code>nop-C</code> instructions inside of it to perform some math using the
new instruction (only the very first <code>nop-C</code> cannot be changed). You
can then either go into zoom mode in the viewer and step through the creature,
or else use analyze mode trace its execution.  If you are going to use zoom
mode, setup your modified creature as the START_CREATURE in configuration file.
If you want to use analyze mode, put the following lines into the
<code>analyze.cfg</code> file in your work/ directory:

<pre>
  LOAD_ORGANISM inst_test.org
  TRACE
</pre>

<p>
Where you have to replace <kbd>inst_test.org</kbd> with the name of the
organism you want to trace.  The new file will appear in the
<kbd>data/archive/</kbd> directory, with the same name as the one you loaded
in, but a <kbd>.trace</kbd> appended to the end.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CPU Components</h3>

<p>
Various CPU components are often manipulated by instructions, and we
need a standard way of doing this.  We have settled on each component being
associated with a method to access it, to provide a single location that can
control that access.  This has already been useful -- in a multi-threaded 
CPU (i.e., a CPU that has multiple positions in its genome being executed at
the same time) each thread has its own registers and heads, so we need to
always be sure we are manipulating the component of the active thread.  If
you simply use the following methods, they will always find the correct
component for you.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<pre>
void <span class="method">StackPush</span>(<span class="class">int</span> <span class="object">value</span>);
<span class="class">int</span> <span class="method">StackPop</span>();
void <span class="method">SwitchStack</span>();
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
There are two stacks in a normal CPU, and more in a multi-threaded version
(one global stack, and one local to each thread).  The first stack method will
place a new value on the top of the currently active stack, the second will
remove the top value, and the last will toggle the currently active stack.
</dd>
<dt>
<pre>
<span class="class">cCPUHead</span>&amp; <span class="method">GetHead</span>(int <span class="object">head_id</span>);
<span class="class">cCPUHead</span>&amp; <span class="method">IP</span>();</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
Each thread in a CPU has four heads associated with it, designated by the
constants <code>HEAD_IP</code>, <code>HEAD_READ</code>,
<code>HEAD_WRITE</code>, and  <code>HEAD_FLOW</code>.  These heads each point
to a position in memory, and all have their own purpose.  A head can be
accessed by passing the appropriate constant into the GetHead() method.  The
extra method IP() was added to more easily obtain just the instruction pointer.
The IP is a very special head since it designates what instruction is going to
be executed next, and often it will make code clearer if you obtain it by
calling IP().  (It will show that you need to make sure of the special
qualities of the instruction pointer.)
</dd>
<dt>
<pre>
int&amp; <span class="method">Register</span>(int <span class="object">reg_id</span>);
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
There are three registers available, associated with the constants
<code>REG_AX</code>, <code>REG_BX</code>, and <code>REG_CX</code>. If the
Register() method is called, an integer reference will be returned associated
with that register.  Any change to this integer will make a corresponding
change to the register in question.
</dd>
<dt>
<pre>
<span class="class">cCPUMemory</span>&amp; <span class="method">GetMemory</span>();
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
This method allows the programmer to access the full memory of the CPU.  As
you know, the class cCPUMemory is built on top of cGenome, so you can
manipulate it in all of the same ways.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These are only a sampling of the available methods of interacting with the
components of the CPU, but they give you a good cross-section without
overwhelming you with all of the possibilities.  You should look through the
source files if you want to see the other options that are available to you.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Helper Methods</h2>

<p>
There are several very common tasks that are performed during the execution
of many of the instructions.  For each of these tasks we have created a
helper function to ease the creation of new instructions.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<pre>
void <span class="method">ReadLabel</span>();
<span class="class">cCodeLabel</span>&amp; <span class="method">GetLabel</span>();
<span class="class">cCPUHead</span> <span class="method">FindLabel</span>(int <span class="object">direction</span>);
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
ReadLabel() will read in the label (series of nop instructions) that
immediately follows the instruction being executed.  The label that was read
can then be accessed (and even modified)  using GetLabel().  Finally, the
Findlabel() method takes single int argument that determines the direction
(from the instruction pointer) in which the label should be search for.  If
this argument is a 1 it will search forward, and if its a -1, it will search
backwards.  A zero indicates that the search should start from the beginning
of the genome, and proceed to the end.  Once it finds the matching label, it
will return a head at the position in which the label was found.  These
helper methods are particularly useful in any instruction that has to affect
other portions of the source code.  See the method Inst_HeadSearch for an
example of how these are used.
</dd>
<dt>
<pre>
int <span class="method">FindModifiedRegister</span>(int <span class="object">default_register</span>);
int <span class="method">FindModifiedHead</span>(int <span class="object">default_head</span>);
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
These two methods will look ahead and determine if a nop instruction is
immediately following the instruction being executed.  If so, it will return
the register or head ID associated with that nop (for use in the rest of the
method), and if no nop is found, it will automatically return the
default value passed in.  We used FindModifiedRegister in the example new
instruction above.
</dd>
<dt>
<pre>
int <span class="method">FindComplementRegister</span>(int <span class="object">base_reg</span>);
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>
Several instructions are defined as affecting a certain, modifiable register
and its complement.  In order to have a standard way of determining the
complement of a register (which, by default, cycle in the same order as
complement labels), we use this function whenever we need to determine one.
See, for example, see the definition of Inst_IfNEqu().
</dd>
</dl>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
To test your understanding of adding instruction into Avida, try writing two
new instructions.  The first one is the mathematical instruction
<strong><code>cube</code></strong> that will take the ?BX? register, and put
its value to the third power.  If you look in the actual source files, you
will see that there is already a <code>square</code> instruction that you can
model this on.
</p>
<p>
Next, you will implement the instruction <strong><code>if-twice</code></strong>
that will execute the next instruction if-and-only-if the value in the ?BX?
register is twice that of the value in its complement.  In other words by
default, if would test of BX was twice CX, but if it is followed by a
<code>nop-C</code> it will test if CX is twice AX.
</p>
<p>
For both of these instruction make sure to craft an organism to test that
they are working properly!
