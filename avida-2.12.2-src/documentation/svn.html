<h1>Using Subversion to Obtain Avida</h1>
</div>

<p>
Avida is a collaborative project developed and maintained by developers
and researchers around the world.  In order to manage the changes from
concurrent development, the Avida source code is maintained within
repository software called Subversion or SVN.  This document provides
directions for obtaining the current source code via anonymous SVN
Web-DAV checkout.
</p>

<p>
Subversion client software can be obtained from Tigris.org at
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Using Subversion</h2>

<p>
Under Unix platforms (Linux, Solaris, OS X), Subversion is used via the
command line.  You issue commands by typing &quot;<tt>svn <i>command</i></tt>&quot;
where you replace <i>command</i> with the command you wish to issue.
</p>

<p>
To download the Avida project, issue the 'checkout' command with the path
to the Avida repository.  The following two command lines show how this
command should look and provide the repository paths.
</p>

<pre>
svn checkout https://avida.devosoft.org/svn/development
</pre>


<p>
When a project is downloaded from the Subversion, it will also create a new
sub-directory inside of each project-directory, called .svn/.  This lets
future SVN commands know the status of all your files and what project they
are part of, so you should never need to tell it again.
<p>

<p>
Here are some of other commands that you can execute inside of a project
that you have retrieved from the Subversion:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>svn update</dt>
<dd>This command will incorporate all changes anyone else has made in
    the project since last time you downloaded it.  If you have made any
    changes to the project yourself, it will merge those changes.</dd>
<dt>svn status</dt>
<dd>This command will tell you the status of each file in the within your
    working copy.  Supplying the option --show-updates will show you updates
    that have occurred within the repository.</dd>
<dt>svn diff &lt;filename&gt;</dt>
<dd>This command will show you any changes that you have made to the file
    since it was last updated.</dd>
<dt>svn help</tt></b>
<dd>Prints a list of all available commands, with a brief description of each.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
If you are just using the SVN in order to have the most up-to-date version
of Avida, than you should never have any problems with it.  An occasional
&quot;<tt>svn update</tt>&quot; when you need a newly implemented feature should do
the trick.  However, if you are going to edit the code (even if you never
plan to commit your changes) there are some other things you need to worry
about.
</p>
<p>
In particular, what happens if both you and someone else edit the source
code at the same time?  Well, in fact the SVN is very good at handling this.
If they are two different files, then there is no problem at all.  If they
are even the <i>same</i> file, but different sections of it, this generally
isn't a problem either -- the SVN will merge the changes smoothly and
correctly.  The real problem is when two people edit the same part of the
same file.
</p>
<p>
When this happens and you try to update, the Subversion will list files
in the update messages with a C in the first column.  After the update, when
you edit the file, you will see that there will be a "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;" on one line in the file,
followed by your edits, then a "===========" and the other persons edits,
and finally a "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;" to indicate the end of the other persons edits.
It is now your job to merge your edits with theirs.  Most of
the time this is caused by two people trying to fix the same bug, and you can
just choose one edit or the other and either will work just fine.
