<p>
This document examines the details of commands directly involved in
replication.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Allocation of Offspring Memory</h2>

<p>
The very first instruction in most heads-based organisms is <code>h-alloc</code>,
which will allocate space for an offspring to be placed into.  If you look at
the file <kbd>source/cpu/cHardwareCPU.cc</kbd>, you will see that this
instruction is associated with the method
<span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Inst_MaxAlloc</span>().
What this means is that the organism will automatically allocate as much
space as it possibly can, without having to first calculate its needs.  When
the organism is finished copying itself and divides off its child, any excess
allocated memory will automatically be discarded.
<p/>
<p>
This Inst_MaxAlloc() method will determine the maximum amount of extra space
that an organism is allowed to allocate, and then run the Allocate_Main()
function passing in that amount.  Allocate_Main is a very long method which is
mostly just check to make sure that everything going on is legal, and then
initializes the new memory that was allocated as per the configuration file:
random, default instruction, or leave as it was in the previous organism that
used it (for &quot;necrophelia&quot;).
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Initial Self-Analysis</h2>

<p>
Most of the initial self-analysis done on Avida organisms is with the
<code>search</code> instruction or one of its variants.  In the heads based
instruction set, we call this <code>h-search</code> and associate it with the
method <span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Inst_HeadSearch</span>().
</p>
<p>
The search type instructions read in the template (series of nops) that
follows it, determine the complement template, and find that complement
elsewhere in the genome.  It then sets the registers BX and CX to be the
distance to the found template and the size of that template respectively.
Finally, we place the flow control head at the end of the template found in
order to reference it later on.  Obviously this last step only occurs
in the heads-based search.
</p>
<p>
The first search instruction executed by a heads organism is typically used
to locate the end of its genome.  The search will place the flow-head at
the end of the genome, which the organism will use to move the write head to
this point as well.  This is done with the <code>mov-head</code> instruction.
</p>
<p>
If the <code>mov-head</code> instruction is followed by a <code>nop-C</code> it
will move the write head to the flow head, and ideally be ready to start
copying itself into the newly allocated space for the offspring.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. The Copy Loop</h2>

<p>
The copy loop is the heart of any organism.  It consists of a setup,
a copy segment to copy one or more instructions, a test segment to determine
if the loop has finished, and a 'jump' type instruction to move back to
copy the next line.
</p>
<p>
In a hand written organism, the setup is an <code>h-search</code> command with
no template to direct its behavior.  The default when this instruction does not
have a template is to just drop the flow-head at the very next instruction,
which is what it is used for here -- it places the flow head at the beginning
of the portion of code that will actually be looped through copying each line.
</p>
<p>
The copy segment is typically just a single <code>h-copy</code> instruction
that will read in an instruction from the location of the read-head, and write
it out to the location of the write-head.  It will then advance both heads to
the next positions in the genomes.  Take a look at the source code for the
method <span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Inst_HeadCopy</span>().
</p>
<p>
The first thing that happens in this method is the variables
<span class="object">read_head</span>,
<span class="object">write_head</span>, and
<span class="object">cpu_stats</span> are setup as references to the
appropriate objects in the hardware and organism (that is, any modifications
to these references change the actual objects, not just a local copy of them).
This is so that we have easy to use variables locally for those objects that
we are working with.  The read_head and write_head are then adjusted to make
sure they are in a legal position on the genome (if, for example, the last
instruction changed the organism's size, the heads might no longer be
pointing to memory that still exists).
</p>
<p>
Next, the instruction at the read head is recorded in the variable
<span class="object">read_inst</span>, and we test to see if this should
be mutated to some other value.  If a mutation does occur, we change the
read_inst variable to a random value, increment the mutation count, and mark
flags at the instruction position of the write head to denote the mutation.
After we determine what instruction was read (be it a correct reading or not),
we call the <span class="method">ReadInst</span>() method, which is simply
used to keep track of the most recent template copied.  This template is used
to help detect the end of the organism, which we shall discuss in a moment.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we collect the statistics that another copy command was executed
in this organism, finish the write by placing this instruction at the position
of the write head (and setting its flag as being a copied instruction) and
then advancing both heads to their next positions.
</p>
<p>
After an organism executes one of these copies it has to test to see if it
is done copying itself.  The heads based organisms will typically do this
with the aid of the <code>if-label</code> instruction, which tests to see if
the most recent label copied is the complement of the one that follows it.
If so, it will execute the next instruction (often a divide), otherwise it
will skip that next instruction and execute a <code>mov-head</code> that will
jump the instruction pointer back to the flow head that was placed at the
beginning of the copy loop.  It will continue this copy-test-jump cycle
until all the lines have been copied.
</p>
<p>
A common adaptation is &quot;unrolling the loop&quot;.
In the hand-written version discussed above, each instruction must have
three instructions executed to copy it: <code>h-copy</code>,
<code>if-label</code>, and <code>mov-head</code>.  But what if a second
<code>h-copy</code> command were inserted after the first?  Now the program
would be one line longer, so it would have more to copy, but each time
through the loop would now copy two instructions while executing four --
that means that on average only two instructions need be executed to copy
one.  A *huge* savings.  The main drawback to the organism is that its 
length will need to be a multiple of two, or else the test to see if it is
finished won't occur at the proper time.  This loop unrolling becomes less
and less beneficial each time the organism does it, so it won't go completely
out of control.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Dividing off the Child</h2>

<p>
When an organism finishes copying itself, it needs to divide off its
child using a divide command.  In the heads based instruction set, this is
the <code>h-divide</code> command which calls the
<span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Inst_HeadDivide</span>()
method.
</p>
<p>
This method will use the read head to determine the starting location of the
offspring, and the write head to determine its end.  This is logical because
these are the locations that the heads should be in right after the copy loop
has finished.  Everything after the write head is cut off and discarded as
&quot;extra lines&quot;. This information is passed into the Divide_Main method
which does the bulk of the work for divide (and is called by all of the various
divide instructions in all of the sets).
</p>
<p>
The <span class="class">cHardwareCPU</span>::<span class="method">Divide_Main</span>()
method is therefore what we are most interested in.  It begins by calculating
the size of that child that would result from the divide point and the
extra_line count that were passed into it, and runs
<span class="method">Divide_CheckViable</span>() to make sure that all of
these values are legal (that is that both parent and child are reasonable
sizes for organisms, and reasonable sizes in relationship to each other -- for
definitions of reasonable as found in the configuration file).  If any of
them are not legal, the method returns false.
</p>
<p>
From this point on, we know the divide is legal, so we just need to process
it.  We create a variable called <span class="object">child_genome</span>,
which we use to construct the child genome.  We use a reference to a cGenome
object inside of the organism so that this child genome is attached to its
parent organism and will be easily accessible from other places where it will
be needed later.  We're not going to be doing all of the work on it right in
this method.  We initialize the child genome to the section of the parents
genome that was created for it.  We then run
<span class="method">Resize</span>() on the parent genome to get
rid of all of this extra space (both child and extra lines).
</p>
<p>
The <span class="method">Divide_DoMutations</span>() method will test and
(if needed) process any divide mutations that may occur.  There are many of
them, so this method is quite long.  It is followed by
<span class="method">Divide_TestFitnessMeasures</span>(), which will run the 
offspring through a test CPU for special options that may be set in the
genesis file (such as mutation reversions).  Obviously this is very processor
intensive since it would occur with every birth, so tests are only performed
if required.  Both of these methods are left to the reader to step through
themselves.
</p>
<p>
If we are using extra costs associated with the first time instructions are
used, those costs a reset now that a divide has occurred, and must be paid for
again on the next divide cycle.
</p>
<p>
After a divide, we mark that we no longer have a mal (Memory ALlocation)
active.  If the parent is reset (i.e., we have two offspring, not a parent
and child) we need to make sure not to advance the IP of the parent.  The
reset parent has its IP placed at the beginning of its genome, and we want
to leave it there to execute the very first instruction.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we tell the organism to activate the divide and do something with
the child.  Give the child to the population (or the test CPU as the case
may be) to be dealt with, and reset the parent if we're splitting into two
offspring.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Other Bits</h2>

<p>
In the description of this life-cycle, one issue that has not been discussed is
where these organisms would perform their computations.  In truth, there  isn't
a fixed time other than it must be before the divide occurs, since merit is
recalculated on a divide.  In practice it will typically be placed right before
the copy loop, but there are plenty of exceptions.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, in the longer term, an organism's life will be composed of much
more than just replication and computations -- they will have to interact with
each other and have more interactions with the environment.  In a
multi-threaded model, organisms will be doing many activities at the same
time.
