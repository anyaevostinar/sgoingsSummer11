<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
Avida is a software platform for experiments with self-replicating and evolving computer programs. It provides detailed
control over experimental settings and protocols, a large array of measurement tools, and sophisticated methods to analyze
and post-process experimental data.
</p>
<p>
In Avida, each digital organism is a self-contained computing automaton that has the ability to construct new automata.
The organism is responsible for building the genome (computer program) that will control its offspring automaton, and
handing that genome to the Avida world. Avida will then construct virtual hardware for the genome to be run on, and
determine how this new organism should be placed into the population. In a typical Avida experiment, a successful
organism attempts to make an identical copy of its own genome, and Avida randomly places that copy into the population,
typically by replacing another member of the population.
</p>
<p>
In principle, the only assumption made about these self-replicating automata in the core Avida software is that their
initial state can be described by a string of symbols (their genome) and that it is possible through processing these
symbols to autonomously produce offspring organisms. However, in practice our work has focused on automata with a simple
von Neumann architecture that operate on an assembly-like language inspired by the Tierra system. Future research projects
will likely have us implement additional oranism instantiations to allow us to explore additional biological questions.
