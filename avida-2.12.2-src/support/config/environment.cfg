# This is the setup file for the task/resource system.  From here, you can
# setup the available resources (including their inflow and outflow rates) as
# well as the reactions that the organisms can trigger by performing tasks.
#
# This file is currently setup to reward 9 tasks, all of which use the
# "infinite" resource, which is undepletable.
#
# For information on how to use this file, see:  doc/environment.html
# For other sample environments, see:  source/support/config/
