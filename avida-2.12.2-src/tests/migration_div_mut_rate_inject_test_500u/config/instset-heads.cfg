# Works on multiple nops:  pop  push  inc  dec  IO  adv-head 

# What if we add a new head.  Search will return the location of something,
# and put the new head there.  Then set-head will move another head to that
# point.  In the case of the copy loop, it only needs to be set once and
# this will speed up the code quite a bit!

# Search with no template returns current position (abs line number) in
# genome.
