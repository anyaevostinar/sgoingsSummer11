   of columns in each line if the runs are not fixed length.  The site
   entropy will be measured in mers, normalized by the instruction set size.
   This is a population/batch measure of entropy, not a mutation-selection balance
   measure.  
=== Action PrintPhenotypicPlasticity ===
  This function will provided detailed information about the phenotypic varients
  of the current population/batch by running each genome through a test cpu <kbd>num_trials</kbd> times.
  If this command is executed in run mode, the
  <kbd>filename</kbd> will be appeneded with <kbd>-Update.dat</kbd> where <kbd>Update</kbd>
  is the current update.  In analyze mode, the default file is merely </kbd>phenplast.dat</kbd>.

  </p>
  <p>
  The <span class="cmdarg">data_fields</span> parameter indicates what
  columns should be included in the file, which must be comma seperated.
  Options are:
  <em>all, id, parent_id, parent2_id (for sex), parent_dist, num_cpus,
  total_cpus, length, merit, gest_time, fitness, update_born, update_dead,
  depth, lineage, sequence.</em>
  Use <em>all</em> (the default) if you want all of the fields included.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <span class="cmdarg">print_historic</span> parameter indicates how
  many updates back in time should be included in this output.  For example,
  '200' would indicate that any ancestor of the current population that died
  out in the last 200 updates should also be printed. A '-1' in this field
  indicates that all ancestors should be printed.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <span class="cmdarg">filename</span> parameter simply indicates what
  you want to call the file.
  </p>
  <p>
  <em>Example</em>:
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>u 1000:1000 print_genotypes id,parent_id,fitness 1000</kbd>
  <br />This will print out the full population every 1000 updates, including all
  genotypes that have died out since the last time it was printed.
=== Action TestDominant ===

  Print out the grid of takss that organisms do. For each organism, tasks are first 
  encoded as a binary string (e.g. 100000001 means that organism is doing NOT and EQU
  and then reported as a base-10 number (257 in the example above).
=== Action DumpDonorGrid ===
  Print out the grid of organisms who donated their merit.
=== Action DumpRecieverGrid ===
  Print out the grid of organisms who received merit.
=== Action SetVerbose ===
  Change the level of output verbosity.  Verbose messages will print all
  of the details of what is happening to the screen.  Minimal messages
  will only briefly state the process being run.  Verbose messages are
  recommended if you're in interactive analysis mode. When no arguments
  are supplied, action will toggle between NORMAL and ON.
  <br />Levels: SILENT, NORMAL, ON, DETAILS, DEBUG
=== Action Inject ===
  Inject a single organisms into the population.  Arguments must be
  included from left to right; if all arguments are left out, the default
  creature is the ancestral organism, and it will be injected into cell 0,
  have an uninitialized merit, and be marked as liniage id 0.
=== Action InjectRandom ===
  Injects a randomly generated genome of the supplied length into the population.
=== Action InjectAll ===
  Same as Inject, but no cell_id is specified and the organism is placed
  into <em>all</em> cells in the population.
=== Action InjectRange ===

=== Action KillProb ===
  Using the specified probability, test each organism to see if it is killed off.
=== Action KillRate ===
  Randomly removes a certain proportion of the population.
  In principle, this action does the same thing as the KillProb event.
  However, instead of a probability, here one has to specify a rate. The
  rate has the same unit as fitness. So if the average fitness is 20000,
  than you remove 50% of the population on every update with a removal rate
  of 10000.
=== Action KillRectangle ===
  Kill off all organisms in a rectangle defined by the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
=== Action SerialTransfer ===
  Similar to KillProb, but we specify the exact number of organisms to

=== Action NewTrial ===
  Immediately calculates the fitness of each organism in the population, saves this value for use with the CompeteOrganisms
  event, and resets the state of all organisms.
=== Action CompeteOrganisms ===
  Calculates fitness of each organism in the population and creates a new population of descendants
  where each organism has a chance of replication proportional to its fitness. Can be used to make Avida 
  operate without population dynamics and asynchronous replication, i.e. like a genetic algorithm. If NewTrial 
  events have occurred since the last CompeteOrganisms event, then the average fitness over those trials 
  will be used.
  </p>
 
  <code>competition_type</code> controls how the fitnesses of multiple trials determine the overall fitness
  used for the competition: 0=geometric mean of fitnesses, 1=scaled geometric mean of fitnesses (the greatest fitness
  of each trial is scaled to 1.0 before taking the geometric mean), 2=arithmetic mean, 3=geometric mean plus 
  rescales effective fitness values by the geometric mean of the difference from the top score and the median.
 <p>Setting <code>parents_survive</code> to 1, causes the first copy of an organism that makes it into the new 
  population to be the original (unmutated) parent organism.
=== Action AnalyzeLandscape ===

  Running <kbd>avida -l filename</kbd> will start an Avida population with the
  saved clone.  Note that a clone only consists of the genomes in
  the population, and their current state is lost, so the run may not
  proceed identically as it would have continued as it was going.
=== Action LoadClone ===
  Sets up a population based on a save file generated by <a href="#SaveClone">SaveClone</a>
    or WRITE_CLONE (an analyze command).  Note that a clone only consists of

    run may not proceed identically as it would have if it had continued as
    it was going.
=== Action LoadPopulation ===

  SavePopulation. It is also possible to append a history file to the
  save file, in order to preserve the history of a previous run.<br>
  <i>update</i> allows user to set the current update number to a new value
=== Action LoadSexPopulation ===
  Sets up a sexual population based on a save file such as written out by
  SaveSexPopulation. It is also possible to append a history file to the
  save file, in order to preserve the history of a previous run.<br>
  <i>update</i> allows user to set the current update number to a new value
=== Action DumpPopulation ===
=== Action SavePopulation ===
  Save the genotypes and lots of statistics about the population to the
  file specified; if not filename is given, use the name
  <kbd>detail-<em>update</em>.pop</kbd>.  As with clones, the update number
  allows a single event to produce many detail files.  The details are used
  to collect crossection data about the population.
=== Action SaveSexPopulation ===
  Save the genotypes and lots of statistics about a population where 
  organisms have two parents to the
  file specified; if not filename is given, use the name
  <kbd>detail-<em>update</em>.pop</kbd>.  As with clones, the update number
  allows a single event to produce many detail files.  The details are used
  to collect crossection data about the population.
=== Action SaveParasitePopulation ===
=== Action SaveHistoricPopulation ===
  This action is used to output all of the ancestors of the currently
  living population to the file specified, or <kbd>historic-<em>update</em>.pop</kbd>.

<h2>Alphabetical Listing of Available Actions</h2>

=== Section Print Actions ===
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="PrintActions">Print Actions</a></h2>

<p>
Output events are the primary way of saving data from an Avida experiments.
The main two types are <em>continuous output</em>, which append to a single file 
every time the event is trigged, and <em>singular output</em>, which produce
a single, complete file for each trigger.
</p>
=== Section Population Actions ===
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="PopulationActions">Population Actions</a></h2>

<p>
Population events modify the state of the population, and will actually
change the course of the run.  There are a wide variety of these.
</p>
=== Section Environment Actions ===
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="EnvironmentActions">Environment Actions</a></h2>

<p>
Events that allow user to change environment properties, such as resources
and reaction parameters.
</p>
=== Section Save Load Actions ===
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="SaveLoadActions">Save Load Actions</a></h2>

<p>
</p>
=== Section Landscape Actions ===
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="LandscapeActions">Landscape Analysis Actions</a></h2>

<p>
Landscape analysis actions perform various types mutation studies to
calculate properties of the fitness landscape for a particular genome.
When scheduled as an event during a run, these actions will typically
perform analysis on the dominant genotype.  In analyze mode, analysis
is performed on the entire currently selected batch.
</p>
<p>
These actions are often very computationally intensive, thus will
take a long time to compute.  In order to take advantage of increasingly

<h2><a name="CreateAction">Creating an Action</a></h2>

<p>
The action source code is contained in the source/action directory.  
Each of the individual <a href="#ActionCategories">action categories</a> has its own source code files (e.g. Landcape Actions are located in the LandscapeActions files).
</p>
<p>Each action is derrived from the cAction class.  Briefly, to get an action to work you must create a child class that has a Process and GetDescription function defined as well as a constructor.  You must also register this new class with the action library.</p>
<p>So, with that quick review of what must be done, here is a step by step guide to creating an action:
<ol>
	<li>Identify which of the action categories your action should be assigned to.  There are six different action categories described <a href="#ActionCategories">above</a>.  Each category has a similar means of creating a new action, but do note that some action commands are generated via macros defined at the top of the files.  For instance, in the PrintActions file, you will notice a number of STATS_OUT_FILE macros being used to generate rather repetitively coded standard output files.&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li><p>Create a new class in the file that follows proper naming conventions.  Any class should begin with "cAction" and be followed by the name of the action command you will register with the library.  For instance, if we were to create a new command "MyAction", we'd name the class cActionMyAction.  Below is a stub for this new action class:</p>
			<p>
			<pre>
class cActionMyAction : public cAction
{
	private:
		// Private data members for this action
	public:
		cActionMyAction(cWorld* world, const cString& args) : cAction(world, args) { ; }
		
		static const cString GetDescription() { return "Arguments: My Arguments"; }
		
		void Process(cAvidaContext& ctx)
		{
			//Perform whatever processing is needed when the action is triggered.
		}
};
</pre></p>

	<li><p>Define the private data members, constructor, description string in GetDescription, and the Process function.  Any arguments that you specify after the action name in the events configuration will be passed to your new class via the args argument in the constructor.</p></li>
	<li><p>Register the new action with the action library.  At the bottom of each action definitions file, there are the commands that register the individual actions with the action library.  In the PrintActions.cc file, for instance, this function is called RegisterPrintActions.
	<p>  To register our example action "MyAction", we'd write:<p>
<p><pre>action_lib->Register&lt;cActionMyAction&gt;("MyAction");</pre><p>
	<li><p>Test your action.</p></li>
	<li><p>Add a ==== Action <i>action name</i> ==== line in
               source/utils/make_actions_html/actions_source_info file</p></li>
</ol>
